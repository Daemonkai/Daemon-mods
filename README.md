# Daemon-s-mods
just a bunch of personal CDDA mods of questionable quality


Adaptive: Basically stats through skills.

Awakening: Foundation of a cultivation mod if I ever get to it. Right now it lets player's raise their stats indefinitely through practice recipes, each stat up takes 20% longer than the last.

Focus perk: a few INT-based perks that set a focus floor you can't drop below. 

Invasions: Monster invasions on a random timer to keep things like base defense interesting
